### Overview
Crypto Economics is about the human side of crytpocurrency and blockchain technology. The ingenious invention of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin, was not only a technology advancement, but also a careful assembly of people who participate in the Bitcoin network. Since 2009, cryptocurrencies have evolved into an industry that has a large market cap worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Furthermore, the underlying blockchain technology has been utilized to create innovative solutions to problems that require decentralization and immutability. Crypto tokens, created on top of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, also facilitate all sorts of incentive systems.
